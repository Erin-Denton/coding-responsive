            <header>Bork. My name is Kaylee. I am dog.</header>
            <main>I am a heckin' normal dog but there is few things you should know about my life. I was birthed in Georgia and grew up with one job: make puppies. I make some puppies but one of my people died and then I had to fend for myself. The people governments made me move to Lakeland FL with lots of other animals that we're bamboozeled. No one here take care of me either and riped out all my hair. I was too scared to do anything so I try to become nice pillow or heap of dirt. Then new people got me and bamboozeled me into eating chimkin and meats which were tastey. I later learned to bork and sleep making cute faces. But okay important three things I promise I am not doing a bamboozle: </main>
            <section class="kaylee">
                <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                    I like to bork. A lot. If you come through the door I bork at you. I am natural herder so I gotta make sure you heckin' sit down and don't stand. I like to bork at things I want but can't get like closed containers of treats or dinner plates. If I bork loud enough the plate will come to me I know it. 
                </div>
                <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                    Garbage is tastiest meal. In my previous life I had to scrounge for foods but garbage has all the tasties treats and smells you could ever want. I like to knock it over, and pull all the papers out and lick the flecks of fuds off it. The best garbage I had was a rotten avocado that was sitting outside by a trash can for weeks. My favorite foods are Chimkin, Spagetters, and Breads. 
                </div>
                <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                    My butthole is tender and makes pooping hard sometimes. I get lasers put on it and it helps sometimes. I think all the food I get into bamboozels me. The human with the pointy sticks say I am allergic to meats and it make my butthole hurt. She doesn't know anything about anything. More chimkin fix everything.
